### Details

-> Built it with material ui. 

-> Tailwind is not used because MUI itself has some utility css. 

-> Some css module classes are also used to reduce repititive work. 

-> Logo image with relative written on it was not included in the mail so, that logo on left top corner is just typography. 

-> colors may not be exactly same but they are doing justice to mockup. 

-> prints the form data on submission as mentioned in the link.
